 Problem #1
------------
 1. The Chennai Super Kings were the most successful team in the IPL with a win percentage of 60.68 and had won the title twice in succession (2010 and 2011).
 The CSKs have played “n” matches so far in IPLs. Given the number of matches “n” that CSK has played and their team score in the matches as a list, 
 write a program to find the total runs and the average runs scored by the team in all “n” matches.


 Input Format:

 First line of the input is an integer “n” that corresponds to the number of matches played by CSK.

 Next “n” lines contains an integer in each line, that corresponds to the runs scored by CSK in each of the “n” matches.


 Output Format:

 Output should print in the first line the integer that gives the total runs scored by CSK in the matches.

 In the second line, print a float value that gives the average runs.

 Sample Input :

 5

 200
 210
 180
 176
 192

 Sample Output :

 958
 191.6

package com.handsonWeek_2_Day_2;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Problem1 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Sample Input :");
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println(n);
		ArrayList<Integer> l1= new ArrayList<>();
		for ( int i =0; i<n;++i) {
			l1.add(sc.nextInt());
		}
		System.out.println("Sample Output :");
		System.out.println((int)sum(l1)+"\n"+(sum(l1)/n));
	}

	static float sum(ArrayList<Integer> m) {
		float sum = 0F;
		for(int i = 0; i < m.size(); i++)
		    sum += m.get(i);
		return sum;
	}

}



 Problem #2
-----------
2. The vice-captain and the leading run-scorer of the team CSK is Suresh Raina.
One of the best fielders in world cricket, Raina is considered as the finest T20 batsman.
Given the number of matches “n” that Raina has played in IPL and his individual score in the matches as a list,
write a program to sort the runs scored by him.


Input Format:

First line of the input is an integer “n” that corresponds to the number of matches played by Raina.

Next “n” lines contains an integer in each line, that corresponds to the runs scored by Raina in each of the “n” matches.

Output Format:

Output should print the runs scored by Raina in sorted order, in “n” lines.

Sample Input :

6

101
78
90
59
77
67

Sample Output :

59
67
77
78
90
101

		}
		System.out.println("Sample Output :");
		Iterator<Integer> itr= t.iterator();
		while(itr.hasNext()) {
			System.out.println(itr.next());
		}

	}
}



Problem #3
-----------
3. Assume the number of matches in total played by CSK is “n” and the venues of each of these matches are given in a string list. Write a program to find the frequency of matches that CSK had played in a particular venue “x”.

Input Format:
First line of the input is an integer “n” that corresponds to the number of matches played by CSK.
Next “n” lines contains each a string corresponding to the venues that CSK played in.
Last line contains a string “x” that corresponds to the particular venue whose frequency has to be found.

Output Format:
Output should display an integer in a single line, that corresponds to the frequency of the matches played in a given venue “x”.

Sample Input :
8
M. A. Chidambaram Stadium
M. A. Chidambaram Stadium
M. A. Chidambaram Stadium
M. Chinnaswamy Stadium
M. Chinnaswamy Stadium
Wankhede Stadium
Eden Gardens
M. A. Chidambaram Stadium
M. A. Chidambaram Stadium

Sample Output :
4
